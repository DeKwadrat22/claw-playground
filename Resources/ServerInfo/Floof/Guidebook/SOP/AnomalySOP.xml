Anomalies (Shadekin) are crew-aligned and have to act like other crew: as if spacelaw applies to them.
Just like any other crew you may break spacelaw for RP causes, but within reason.
You cannot use your teleport abilities to tresspass in areas which also means you cannot steal or use items from closed rooms or departments without permission from command or all of the department workers.

In the event of player controlled antagonists, actions like stalking antags and calling out their locations/actions/etc. while using the phase ability is considered an offense (we have station AI for a reason.) as it will be unfun for antagonists to do their thing.

In case of extreme emergencies, such as code red scenarios, anomalies can attempt to arm themselves through legal means which does not involve secure tresspass.
Command and security personnel are not allowed to arm anomalies during emergencies, so it is up to the anomaly to try and be helpful without breaking spacelaw and without making others break it.

Anomalies aren't crew therefore they do not enjoy the rights extended to crew by spacelaw. Any spacelaw infraction no matter how minor could result in a kill on sight order from command or the warden.
